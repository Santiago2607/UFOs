# UFOs
## Overview of the Project

For this project, we were able to help Dana, a researcher of everything related to UFOs ("Unidentified Flying Objects"), to create a webpage where she can share with everybody the different events where there has been a "sighting." In order to create a proper webpage where people can search for information and get fast and good-quality outputs, we decided to use the programming language of Javascript along with HTML. These two great tools with such great capacities can help us a lot during this exciting project. 

## Results

During the process of creating our webpage, we decided to create some filters such as entering a city, state, date, and more, to make it easier for people to find what they are looking for and help them live an exciting experience while looking for an exciting topic.

In addition, we wanted people to look date after date in a fast way and without cleaning each filter before entering new data. The decision we came up with was to create a refresh button that will delete all the information and charge the page again just by clicking on it. This button is located on the top left of the webpage and its name (UFO Sightings) is related to the topic so it gives the user a better perspective of how everything is connected.

## Summary

One big drawback we had during the development of this project was the fact to make all the filters work. In the beginning, we had no problem using and filtering the data by date, however, as we continue adding more filters it was getting more difficult to make all of them work properly and efficiently.

Finally, despite the fact the webpage is already done, there are still some adjustments that we can do it to the page.

- First, it will be a good idea to have a button that filters all the data besides pressing "Enter" that get the same result. We considered this since there are people that like to have that old-school structure and having two ways to get the data gives more advantages to the page than only one.

- Second, a webpage with such an exciting topic should have a box where users can leave their experience, and some links to webpages related to this same topic or to other webpages that Dana would like to create in the future. This way, users do not get stuck just on one page but in a couple that in the end share the same topic but different and new information.
